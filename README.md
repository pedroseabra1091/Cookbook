This is a playground created to explore Ecto's capabilities during Elixir session # 5. 

Addresses the following topics:
- Migrations
- Schemas
- Repo
- Changesets
- Associations
  - `has_many`
  - `many_many` 
  - `many_many` with fields in the join table
- cast_assoc vs put_assoc


Future work:
- Multi
- Transaction

## Notes
- execute `bin/setup` from the root of the project

- `iex -S mix` to access iex shell with the Ecto dependencies
